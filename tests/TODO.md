TODO figure out a way to have a different test implimitations for each container 
but use only one main.cpp to run them per command line arguments given ex: 
`STLPROJECT Vector.h` will only run the Vector tests, no argument will run all tests.


TODO: change the name of the project from MYVECTOR to STLPROJECT.

TODO: Fix all CMakeLists.txt files.
