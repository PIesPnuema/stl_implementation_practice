# Includes 

Here you will find the template header files. Refer to the root [README.md](https://github.com/PIesPnuema/stl_implimitation_practice/blob/main/README.md) file for information on how to 
compile tests using cmake.

#### This project is my own implimitation of the std::library containers. The purpose is just to learn and have fun. 

#### Please feel free to let me know if there's a better method of implimitation for the following:
- Structure on how I have built the project. From directory names/locations to how I ran my UnitTests.
- Functions that may be implimented better. 
- Structure of the code regarding comments and style.
- Errors. If they are there (they are) please point them out. 

I wish to take in any feed back to help expand my knowledge. Thanks for stoping by.
