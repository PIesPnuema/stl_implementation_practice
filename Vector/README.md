# Vector.h 
----

#### This project is a recreation of the std::library container `vector`. Just for Fun. 

----

#### Please feel free to let me know if there's a better method of implimitation for the following:
- Structure on how I have built the project. From directory names/locations to how I ran my UnitTests.
- Functions that may be implimented better. 
- Structure of the code regarding comments and style.
- Errors. If they are there (they are) please point them out.

I wish to take in any feed back to help expand my knowledge. Thanks for stoping by.
